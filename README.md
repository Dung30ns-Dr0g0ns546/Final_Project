# Final_Project

# Algorithm for Final Project

# Employee
Employee works off the same mechanics as the User class and HasMenu class, onlty except the user can choose to either manage their resume, look through job openings, and change their password

# Employer
Same as the Employee class, it works off the same mechanics as the User class and HasMenu class, only except the user can choose to either get a full employee report, add an employee to their roster, remove an employee from their roster, and post job openings

# HasMenu
The essential building block to my entire final project. Basically allows me to use menus for my classes

# JobApplication
The main face of my project. It allows the user to choose between logging in as a employee or an employer, before doing one of the many choices that specific class allows

# JobOpening
It allows the user to build a job opening if they are an employer, creating Job titles, descriptions, requirements, slots available, and the salary

# Resume
Resume is like Job Opening, but for employees. The user can change anything on the resume - from their name, email, phone number, their education, experiences, certifications, skills, and a summary of everything

# User
Another essential building block, this allows the user to type in a name and password
